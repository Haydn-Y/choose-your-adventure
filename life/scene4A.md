# Scene 4: Try to Pump It Back Up

You decided to try to pump up your flat tire.

Stepping into your garage, you move around some old decorations and uncover an old electric tire pump. You brush off the dust and examine the pump while you start towards your immobilized vehicle.

You unscrew your tire cap (probably, I don't know how to pump up tires) and place the pump's attached hose over the inlet. You flick the on/off switch and wait.

##### And wait.

###### And wait.
