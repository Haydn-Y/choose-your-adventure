# Scene 2: Climb Out of Bed and Get Ready

You ascend from your mattress as if a holy spirit were lifting you up by its very own hand. You sacredly levitate towards your wardrobe. As if you were God himself, the almond varnished wardrobe doors begin to open.

 Your absolute finest garments escape your wardrobe and sail around you, gently attaching themselves to your holy self. As you yourself are already perfect, there's nothing else you need to get ready for. Since getting ready is second nature, you have plenty of time to spare.
