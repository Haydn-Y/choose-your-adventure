# Scene 2: Slam your alarm against the opposite wall and fall back asleep

Out of pure rage, you gently unplugged your alarm by the plug (safety first) and hurled it at the opposite wall, breaking it into thousands of small plastic shards.

Relieved, you pull your covers up to your neck and fall back asleep with a smile on your face. Blissfully, as if nothing were happening that day.

You wake up and check your clock. You missed your date. Crap.
